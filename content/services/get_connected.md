1. Acquire an Autonomous System Number (ASN) and Public IP address space from AFRINIC(link this) or another Regional Internet Registry (RIR).
2. Send us an introductory message through our online contact form which includes your ASN and other basic data about your company/organization. Please also indicate which services you wish to receive from us. We will reply as soon as possible and provide guidance throughout the rest of the joining process.
3. Review and submit a signed copy of our Participation Agreement along with a Service Order Form either by e-mail (preferred) or by post to our mailing address. We will send you an initial invoice following completion of this step.
4. Meet with us to tour our facility and discuss deployment plans.
5. Submit payment and extend your network to our facility either via fibre or a wireless radio link. Note that we have rack-space available for peering related equipment, and each peer is eligible for 2RU free of charge.
6. Connect your network equipment to our switching equipment using the specific port and IPv4/6 addresses that we assign you. We will also assign you a username and password for our online customer portal.
7. Optionally configure an IPv4 and IPv6 BGP session with our route servers and/or work to establish bilateral BGP sessions with other networks at the exchange.
